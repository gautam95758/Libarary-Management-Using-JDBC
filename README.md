# Library Management System Using JDBC

This project is a Library Management System built using Java with JDBC for database connectivity. The system provides a simple interface for managing library resources, including books, members, and transactions. It is designed as a console or GUI-based application (depending on your implementation) that demonstrates fundamental CRUD operations and JDBC integration.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and search for books in the library.
- **Member Management**: Register new members, update member details, and manage membership information.
- **Issue/Return Books**: Issue books to members and manage book returns.
- **View Records**: Display all books, issued books, and member lists.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for books or members using various criteria.
- **Database Integration**: Uses JDBC for seamless interaction with a relational database (e.g., MySQL).

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (Core language)
- **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity)
- **MySQL** or other relational databases
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for any web-based GUI, if implemented)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- MySQL or another supported RDBMS
- JDBC driver for your database

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gautam95758/Libarary-Management-Using-JDBC.git
   cd Libarary-Management-Using-JDBC
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   - Create a new database (e.g., `library_db`)
   - Execute the provided SQL scripts (if any) to create necessary tables.

3. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Open the configuration file or Java class containing database connection details.
   - Update the JDBC URL, username, and password as per your setup.

4. **Build and Run**
   - Compile the Java source files:
     ```bash
     javac *.java
     ```
   - Run the main application:
     ```bash
     java MainClassName
     ```
   - (Replace `MainClassName` with the actual main class name.)
